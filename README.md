# Advent of Code

Does what it says on the tin.

### The code

Code is organized by year, then day. The puzzle input is in `input.txt`, and the Ruby code to calculate the result is in `main.rb`.

The easiest way to run the tests for a particular day and get the result is with the `rerun` gem.

```
gem install rerun

cd 2021/01
rerun -bcx --no-notify -- ruby main.rb
```
